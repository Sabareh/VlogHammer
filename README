         Vlog-Hammer -- A Verilog Synthesis Regression Test
         ==================================================

This test generates a large number of small Verilog modules and checks
different synthesis tools for equivialence. The following tools are
supported:

	Yosys (no specific version)
	Xilinx Vivado WebPack (2013.2)
	Xilinx ISE (XST) WebPack (14.5)
	Altera Quartus Web Edition (13.0)

In addition to this synthesis tools, the offending test cases and pattern
are checked using the following Verilog synthesis tools:

	Xilinx ISIM (from Xilinx ISE 14.5)
	Modelsim 10.1d (from Quartus 13.0)
	Icarus Verilog (no specific version)

Instructions:

 * Install Xilinx Vivado WebPack 2013.2 in /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2013.2
 * Insatll Xilinx ISE WebPack 14.5 in /opt/Xilinx/14.5/
 * Install Altera Quartus Web Edition 13.0 in /opt/altera/13.0/

 * Generate Test Cases:

	make purge generate

 * Synthesize Test Cases:

	make -j4 -l6 syn

 * Check Individual Synthesis Results vs. Yosys RTL:

	make -j4 -l6 check

 * Generate Reports on Failed Test Cases:

	make -j4 -l6 report
