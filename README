         Vlog-Hammer -- A Verilog Synthesis Regression Test
         ==================================================

This test generates a large number of small Verilog modules and checks
different synthesis tools for equivialence. The following tools are
supported:

	Yosys (no specific version)
	Xilinx Vivado WebPack (2013.3)
	Xilinx ISE (XST) WebPack (14.7)
	Altera Quartus II Web Edition (13.1)

The built-in SAT-solver in Yosis is used for formal equivalence checking.
The test cases that fail this check and the found example pattern are
then tried using the following Verilog simulators:

	Xilinx ISIM (from Xilinx ISE 14.7)
	Modelsim 10.1d (from Quartus 13.1)
	Icarus Verilog (no specific version)

Instructions:

 * Install Yosys (yosys) and Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
 * Install Xilinx Vivado WebPack 2013.3 in /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2013.3
 * Insatll Xilinx ISE WebPack 14.7 in /opt/Xilinx/14.7/
 * Install Altera Quartus Web Edition 13.1 in /opt/altera/13.1/

 * Generate Test Cases:

	make purge generate

 * Synthesize Test Cases:

	make -j4 -l8 syn

 * Check Individual Synthesis Results vs. Yosys RTL:

	make -j4 -l8 check

 * Generate Reports on Failed Test Cases:

	make -j4 -l8 report
